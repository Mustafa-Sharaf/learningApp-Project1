## ðŸš€ Intro
Our application primarily connects students (users) with teachers, providing a digital environment that facilitates educational processes for each subject. This includes viewing videos and files, obtaining detailed information and guidance from experts, and allowing users to view specific courses. Users can also manage and control published content, and customize the user experience by following teachers and the teacher's course. We provide a wide range of preferred options, enabling users to always choose the best. Additionally, we enable users to engage in an interactive environment with teachers by completing assignments, earning points, and sharing opinions and ideas with teachers, as well as answering students' questions. We also provide a search and content filtering mechanism within the application to facilitate the user's appropriate presentation based on their specializations and educational interests.
